<h1>Words Per Page: convert words to pages calculator</h1>

Many companies and freelancers, translators have to deal with PDF files. Often with such work, there is a need to quickly assess the amount of text contained in them. But there is no such possibility in PDF format, and in popular applications for viewing PDF documents you can find out only the total number of pages.

It would seem that you can roughly imagine how much text can fit on so many pages. But this does not work, because:

fonts of different sizes may be used in the file
the file may contain figures and tables, which significantly increase its volume
the file may contain cover pages with one or two lines of text, etc.
Therefore, it will be necessary to find out the volume of the file you need in a different way. There are two ways to do this:

Copy all text (Ctrl A) and paste it into a Word document (see How to find out the number of characters in Word). However, this method does not always work. 

f you provide a document in electronic form, then the number of characters can be found using the character counting option (in Microsoft Word - menu Tools - Statistics, value with spaces; in Open Office - menu Tools - Word Count - Entire document - characters)
The indicated value must be divided by 1800 and multiplied by the cost of one account page, this cost is indicated in our price list. (see back of this page)

If you provide a document for translation on paper or in scanned form, then the manager will help you calculate the cost of the translation.
