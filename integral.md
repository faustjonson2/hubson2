In various physical contexts, there are problems containing one or more small parameters. In what follows, we will consider the case when the problem has one small parameter,
which we denote. Of particular interest is the case when the solution to the problem for = 0 is known. Then
the solution to the original problem can be constructed in the form of an expansion in a small parameter, such an expansion
called perturbation theory. For example, in the framework of perturbation theory, one can usually consider
the interaction of radiation with matter.
If we solve ordinary (algebraic or transcendental) equations containing small
parameter, then the final result differs little from the unperturbed (i.e., obtained at
= 0) of the solution x0. As a rule, the deviation of the exact solution from the solution of the unperturbed equation
(that is, the equation in which it is set equal to zero) is obtained as a series in. For building
of this series, an iterative process can be used. To this end, members are proportional,
the value x0 is substituted, after which the correction x1 to x0 is found. Further, the adjusted value x0 + x1
is substituted in proportional terms, and the correction x2 is found. Continuing this procedure, we
we find the expansion in the exact solution of the equation x = x0 + x1 + x2 +. . . .
• Find the first two corrections to the unperturbed solution x0 = 1 of the equation x
2 - 1 = x.

Compare the result with the exact solution.
If the perturbation occurs at the point of degeneration (when several solutions of the unperturbed equation coincide), then the expansion of the solution can occur in non-integer degrees. For example, solutions of the equation (x - 1) 2 = have the form x1,2 = 1 ±
√
. However, even in these degenerate cases
the solution of the perturbed equation for small is close to the solution of the unperturbed.
